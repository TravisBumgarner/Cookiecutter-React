# Farewell

Over the past year or so, I've taken a long hard look at how I invest my time on side projects. Maintaining boilerplates and building my own design systems end up in me getting off track. I end up burning out and not completing side projects. This package has served me well. However, it makes more sense to switch to Create React App and focus more on what matters in side projects.

# Usage

1. `brew install cookiecutter`
2. `cookiecutter gh:TravisBumgarner/cookiecutter-react`
